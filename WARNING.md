# ⚠️ DawgDroid Full Build Warnings

This package includes placeholders for:
- **Kernel sources / device trees**
- **Proprietary vendor blobs**
- **Magisk (root management)**
- **Model weights for on-device AI**

## ⚠️ Risky Features
- Overclocking CPU/GPU may **damage hardware permanently** if misconfigured.
- Kernel mods may cause **bootloops** or **instability**.
- Root access (Magisk) can **break SafetyNet**, **void warranty**, and **expose security risks**.
- Using third-party proprietary blobs may be **legally restricted**.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Always backup before flashing.
- Only flash on test devices, not daily drivers.
- Double-check kernel frequency tables before enabling overclocking.
- Use trusted sources for vendor blobs and Magisk builds.
- Respect license terms for model weights.

Proceed only if you understand the risks. DawgDroid is provided **AS-IS** with no guarantees.
